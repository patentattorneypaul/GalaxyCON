# GalaxyCon Richmond 2026 — Convention Comparison Report
## Paul's Take in a Nutshell
Seems like this conference is really designed for those who want to meet celebrities and engage with pop culture fandom, rather than for those who are primarily interested in gaming or music. If you're a fan of the guests and want to experience the celebrity interactions, it's a great option given its proximity. But if you're looking for deep gaming experiences or live music, the other cons you've attended (Gen Con, PAX Unplugged, MAGFest) will likely offer more of what you enjoy. The add-on pricing for celebrity experiences at GalaxyCon can make it more expensive than it initially appears, so it's important to consider how much value you place on those interactions when deciding whether to attend.

## What Is GalaxyCon Richmond?

GalaxyCon Richmond is a four-day pop culture and fan convention held annually at the Greater Richmond Convention Center (403 N. Third St, Richmond, VA 23219). The 2026 edition runs **March 19–22** (Thursday through Sunday). Organized by GalaxyCon LLC — the largest independently owned consumer fan engagement company in the U.S. — the event bills itself as a "Festival of Fandom" covering comic books, sci-fi, fantasy, anime, gaming, cosplay, professional wrestling, and general pop culture.

GalaxyCon Richmond has grown rapidly, jumping from 10,000–15,000 attendees in its early years to over **45,000 attendees** at the 2024 event, which generated an estimated $10.3 million in direct economic impact for the Richmond region. Organizers expected approximately 40,000 attendees in 2025 and the 2026 show is likely to be similar or larger.

The convention's primary draw is its **celebrity guest roster**. The 2026 lineup includes Hayden Christensen (Star Wars), William Shatner (Star Trek), Edgar Wright (director), Ming-Na Wen (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. / The Mandalorian), Kevin Smith, Jason Mewes, "Weird Al" Yankovic, BD Wong, and the cast of Jurassic Park (Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards, Wayne Knight), among roughly 100 celebrity, voice actor, comic creator, and wrestling guests. GalaxyCon operates across eight U.S. cities, and the Richmond show is one of its flagship events.

## The Three Comparison Conventions

### Gen Con (Indianapolis, IN)

Gen Con is North America's largest and longest-running tabletop gaming convention, founded in 1968 by Gary Gygax (co-creator of Dungeons & Dragons). Held annually at the Indiana Convention Center and Lucas Oil Stadium, it drew a record **~72,000 unique attendees** in 2025. Gen Con 2026 runs **July 30 – August 2**. The convention features 575+ exhibiting companies, 30,000+ ticketed events, and is laser-focused on tabletop gaming: board games, card games, RPGs, miniatures wargames, and seminars. It bills itself as "The Best Four Days in Gaming."

### PAX Unplugged (Philadelphia, PA)

PAX Unplugged is the tabletop-focused spinoff of the PAX (Penny Arcade Expo) convention series, organized by ReedPop and Penny Arcade. Held at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia since 2017, it has grown into the **second-largest tabletop gaming convention** in the U.S. The 2024 edition sold out all three days for the first time, with 350+ exhibitors occupying all 528,000 square feet of expo hall space. Estimated attendance exceeds 25,000–30,000. PAX Unplugged 2026 runs **December 4–6** (three days, Friday through Sunday).

### MAGFest / Super MAGFest (National Harbor, MD)

MAGFest (Music And Gaming Festival) is a nonprofit four-day festival dedicated to video game music, gaming culture, and community. Held at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in National Harbor, MD, Super MAGFest 2026 ran **January 8–11, 2026** and was completely **sold out** at approximately 30,000 attendees. The event is famous for running **24 hours a day**, with a massive free-play arcade hall, console gaming rooms, live concerts by video game cover bands and chiptune artists, a LAN party, indie game showcase (MIVS), tabletop gaming, and DJ battles.

## Where GalaxyCon Is Similar to Cons You've Attended

**Shared convention DNA.** All four events are multi-day, badge-based fan gatherings that feature exhibit halls with vendors, panels with guest speakers, cosplay communities, and a general atmosphere of enthusiastic nerd culture. You'll recognize the rhythm: badge pickup, exhibition hall browsing, scheduled panel sessions, late-night social events, and the familiar vendor marketplace of collectibles, art prints, and fandom merchandise.

**Cosplay culture.** GalaxyCon shares a strong cosplay scene with all three comparisons. Like PAX Unplugged and MAGFest, costumes are encouraged but not required, and GalaxyCon features dedicated cosplay contests with cash prizes exceeding $4,000.

**Evening programming.** Both GalaxyCon and MAGFest run events well past typical convention hours. GalaxyCon's Friday and Saturday events run until 1:00 AM (exhibition hall closes at 8 PM but entertainment continues), which is reminiscent of MAGFest's 24-hour model, though not quite as extreme.

**VIP tiers.** Like Gen Con's VIG (Very Important Gamer) program, GalaxyCon offers a tiered VIP structure with premium badges ($299+ for 4-day VIP, higher for Premium Reserve VIP) that provide fast-lane access, VIP lounges, cocktail parties, and guaranteed seating — a familiar upsell model.

**Community atmosphere.** All four cons cultivate a welcoming, judgment-free atmosphere. Attendees at each describe a sense of finding "your people," whether that's around a gaming table at Gen Con, a freeplay area at PAX Unplugged, the arcade hall at MAGFest, or Celebrity Row at GalaxyCon.

## Where GalaxyCon Is Different

**Celebrity-centric vs. activity-centric.** This is the fundamental distinction. Gen Con, PAX Unplugged, and MAGFest are *participatory* conventions — you go to *do things* (play games, attend concerts, compete in tournaments). GalaxyCon is primarily a *celebrity engagement* convention — you go to *meet people* (actors, voice actors, comic creators, wrestlers). The celebrity photo op and autograph economy is GalaxyCon's core business model. Photo ops and autographs are purchased separately (often $40–$150+ each, with premium packages for top-tier celebrities running significantly higher), which is a cost structure that doesn't exist at the other three cons.

**Exhibit hall composition.** Gen Con and PAX Unplugged feature exhibit halls dominated by game publishers demoing and selling new products. MAGFest has a smaller vendor hall alongside its indie game showcase. GalaxyCon's exhibit hall is a mix of pop culture merchandise vendors, artist alley booths, and comic book dealers — more akin to a collectibles bazaar than a product-launch trade show.

**Gaming depth.** If tabletop gaming is your primary interest, GalaxyCon will feel shallow compared to Gen Con or PAX Unplugged. GalaxyCon has a gaming section and runs some events at nearby hotels, but it is not built around gaming the way Gen Con (with 30,000+ scheduled events) or PAX Unplugged (with massive freeplay libraries and tournament infrastructure) are. Similarly, MAGFest's 24-hour arcade and console halls dwarf anything GalaxyCon offers in the gaming space.

**Music and live entertainment.** MAGFest is in a league of its own here with multi-stage concert programming running throughout the festival. GalaxyCon has some evening entertainment (Rocky Horror shadowcast, themed cocktail parties like "Drunk on Disney"), but it's not a music festival. Gen Con and PAX Unplugged each have some concert programming but nothing close to MAGFest's scale.

**No-refund, add-on pricing model.** GalaxyCon's pricing model is more layered and add-on heavy than the other three. Your admission ticket gets you in the door, but celebrity experiences (photo ops, autographs, special meet-and-greets) require additional tickets that are separately purchased, non-refundable, and non-transferable. Gen Con's event tickets are mostly $2 generics. PAX Unplugged and MAGFest are largely "badge gets you everything" models.

**Nonprofit vs. commercial.** MAGFest is a registered nonprofit run largely by volunteers. Gen Con and PAX Unplugged are commercial but organized by well-established companies (Gen Con LLC and ReedPop/Penny Arcade). GalaxyCon is a privately owned, for-profit fan engagement company — the most overtly commercial of the four.

### GalaxyCon Richmond

**Cons:**

- Celebrity photo ops and autographs are expensive add-ons (often $40–$150+ each, on top of admission)
- Thin on structured gaming compared to Gen Con or PAX Unplugged
- Reports of overcrowding and logistical issues at the 2024 event (long lines, ATM shortages, crowd management problems); the 2025 Columbus show drew ADA compliance criticism
- Vendor marketplace quality is inconsistent — some attendees have noted resold mass-market goods alongside genuine artist and creator booths

- Convention center size may be reaching capacity as attendance grows

### Gen Con

**Pros:**

- Largest tabletop gaming convention in North America with unmatched gaming depth (30,000+ events)
- 575+ exhibiting companies with new game demos and exclusive releases
- Incredible community and atmosphere ("The Best Four Days in Gaming")
- Well-established infrastructure and logistics after decades of operation
- Outdoor block party with food trucks and beer garden adds to the festival feel

**Cons:**

- Farthest from Alexandria (~9 hours drive or requires a flight)
- Most expensive total trip cost due to travel, 3+ nights of hotel, and Indianapolis pricing during the convention
- Hotels in the Gen Con block sell out almost instantly; downtown Indianapolis rates spike dramatically
- Saturday single-day badge ($112) is the most expensive single-day option of any con compared here
- Can be overwhelming for first-timers; event registration system has a steep learning curve

### PAX Unplugged

**Pros:**

- Second-largest tabletop gaming convention in the U.S. with a strong East Coast location
- Excellent exhibit hall with 350+ exhibitors including major publishers and indie developers
- Strong freeplay areas with extensive game libraries — great for trying new games
- Well-managed crowd flow (improved significantly in recent years)
- Most affordable option: ~$94 for a 3-day badge, single days $44–$45
- Philadelphia is easily accessible from the mid-Atlantic

**Cons:**

- Only 3 days (Friday–Sunday), making it the shortest of the four
- No celebrity meet-and-greet culture
- Limited evening/late-night programming compared to GalaxyCon or MAGFest
- Sold out all three days in 2024, so badges may be hard to acquire in future years
- Less diverse programming than GalaxyCon (almost exclusively tabletop-focused)

### MAGFest

**Pros:**

- Closest to Alexandria (~20 minutes) — no hotel needed if you prefer day trips
- 24-hour programming is unmatched; arcade hall and console rooms never close
- Incredible live music programming with video game cover bands, chiptune artists, and DJs
- Free-play arcade cabinets, console gaming, and LAN party all included with badge
- Strong community feel as a nonprofit, volunteer-driven event
- Indie game showcase (MIVS) features 40–60 booths of up-and-coming developers

**Cons:**

- Completely sold out for 2026 (no badges available at the door)
- No single-day tickets — must buy the full 4-day badge ($125–$165)
- Minimal celebrity or pop culture content
- The Gaylord resort venue can feel isolated from surrounding dining and entertainment
- Not tabletop-focused — tabletop gaming exists but is secondary to arcade, console, and music
- Limited vendor/dealer presence compared to the other three

## Bottom Line

GalaxyCon Richmond occupies a different niche than the other three cons you've attended. Gen Con, PAX Unplugged, and MAGFest are all fundamentally about *playing* — games, music, or both. GalaxyCon is fundamentally about *fandom engagement* — meeting the actors, artists, and creators behind the franchises you love. If your motivation is meeting William Shatner, getting a photo with Hayden Christensen, having Kevin Smith sign a poster, or browsing Artist Alley for original comic art, GalaxyCon delivers that experience better than any of the other three. If you're looking for deep tabletop gaming, live concerts, or 24-hour arcade access, you'll find GalaxyCon thinner in those areas.

The value proposition depends on what you want. A Saturday single-day badge at GalaxyCon ($75) plus one celebrity photo op could easily run $125–$200+ for a few hours of focused celebrity interaction. By contrast, a full 4-day Gen Con badge ($164) or a 3-day PAX Unplugged badge ($94) gives you nearly unlimited gaming for the entire event. GalaxyCon's add-on pricing means your total spend is less predictable and can escalate quickly.

That said, GalaxyCon Richmond's proximity to Alexandria (just a 2-hour drive) and its massive celebrity guest list make it a compelling day-trip option. You could grab a single Thursday badge ($45) to get a feel for the event without a major commitment, avoid the Saturday crowds, and decide whether the full experience is worth the investment in future years.
